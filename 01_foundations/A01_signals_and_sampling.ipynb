    "Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the electrical activity of the brain as it unfolds continuously in time. The voltage fluctuations at each electrode reflect the summed activity of thousands of neurons, creating complex waveforms that carry information about cognitive processes, emotional states, and neural communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, computers cannot store continuous signals. Instead, they capture discrete samples at regular intervals, converting the smooth, continuous reality into a sequence of numbers. This process of **sampling** is fundamental to all digital signal processing, and understanding it is essential for proper EEG analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of our analysis depends critically on how well these discrete samples represent the original continuous signal. Sample too slowly, and we lose important information. Sample too quickly, and we waste storage and computational resources. Finding the right balance requires understanding the relationship between sampling rate and the frequencies present in our signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical EEG systems sample at rates between 256 Hz and 1024 Hz. By the end of this notebook, you will understand why these values are chosen and what happens when sampling goes wrong."

    "A **continuous signal** is a mathematical idealization: a function defined at every point in time. If we could measure brain activity with infinite precision, we would obtain such a continuous signal, with a voltage value for every instant, no matter how small the time interval.\n",

We measure the signal at regular intervals, determined by the **sampling interval** $\\Delta t$ (the time between consecutive samples). The **sampling rate** (or sampling frequency) $f_s$ is the number of samples per second:\n",

    "\n",
    "EEG amplifiers include **anti-aliasing filters** (low-pass filters) that remove high frequencies before digitization.

This prevents muscle artifacts and electrical noise from aliasing into the EEG frequency range.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Digital signals are discrete samples** of continuous phenomena, captured at regular intervals determined by the sampling rate\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sampling rate determines temporal resolution** and limits the frequencies we can represent; higher sampling rates capture finer details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Nyquist theorem states $f_s > 2 f_{max}$** to avoid aliasing; the Nyquist frequency $f_N = f_s/2$ is the highest representable frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aliasing creates false low-frequency components** when high frequencies are undersampled; these artifacts are indistinguishable from real low-frequency signals\n",

    "- **EEG systems use anti-aliasing filters** before digitization to prevent high-frequency artifacts from corrupting the data\n",

    "## Discussion Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "For the live session, consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **An EEG system samples at 256 Hz. A participant has strong muscle artifact at 150 Hz. What will happen to this artifact in the recorded data if no anti-aliasing filter is applied?**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **You want to study gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz). What is the minimum sampling rate you would need? What sampling rate would you actually recommend, and why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why might a researcher choose to record at 1024 Hz even if they only care about frequencies below 50 Hz?**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Two signals look identical after sampling. Does this mean they were the same signal before sampling? Why or why not?**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **In hyperscanning, two EEG systems must be synchronized. How might small differences in actual sampling rate (e.g., 255.8 Hz vs 256.2 Hz) affect connectivity analysis over a long recording?**"
